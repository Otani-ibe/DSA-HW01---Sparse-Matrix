# Sparse Matrix Project

## Overview

This project introduces a Sparse Matrix class in Python, designed for efficient storage and manipulation of large matrices containing numerous zero elements. It includes methods for loading and saving matrices from files, as well as performing various matrix operations.

## Features

- Import sparse matrices from text files.  
- Export sparse matrices to text files.  
- Perform fundamental matrix operations (e.g., addition, multiplication).  
- Ensure robust error handling for file format inconsistencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Otani-ibe/DSA-HW01---Sparse-Matrix.git
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
